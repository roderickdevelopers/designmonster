Design Monster is a website which allows inventors to get the resources they need to launch an idea, a design or a product.  The concept is that it acts as a catalyst for those who may not know how to get their ideas up and running.  From clarifying the concepts all the way to prototyping, Design Monster can offer services for all levels of development.

My approach to building this site was to focus on getting an initial framework down so that it could be used immediately as a foundation for future development.  I would like to implement all of the stretch goals in the weeks following the GA class, including learning how to implement my own Auth using simpleAuth, and using other add-ons like mirage-cli drag and drop add ons.  I am hoping that this site becomes a larger, more complex and fully functioning site which will continuously grow.

I began the Capstone project with detailed wireframes.

I then began building my backend to fit what I knew I would need, and what I had planned for the future.  The next step was to build out and Ember shell. When those tasks were complete, I deployed both back and front end.  On successful deploy I began building my front end, using the wireframes and User stories as a guide.

The largest issue that I faced was scaling back enough to build a solid foundation while still having the site be usable.  I had a few learning experiences too.  I learned that even if you don’t think you need one, you may need to make a component.  You can’t pass actions and data sideways, Ember doesn’t like it.  GitHub was also a sloppy process compared to the previous projects, as Ember build creates files even when you switch branches.  It may be easier in the future to implement features fully on a local site and deploy when everything is ready.
